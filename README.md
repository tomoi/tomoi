Welcome to my GitHub page. Take off your jacket, pull up a chair, and stay awhile.
 
 I am a recent graduate from **Saskatchewan Polytechnic** in the **Interactive Design and Technology** program. 
 My main focus is Front-end Development and React. 

 When I'm not building websites, I'm usually playing videogames or trying to learn Substance Designer and Substance painter using online tutorials.
